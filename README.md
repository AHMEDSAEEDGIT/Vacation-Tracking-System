# Vacation Tracking System (VTS)



## 📌 Project Vision

Vacation Tracking System (VTS) empowers employees to independently manage their vacation time, sick leave, and personal time off. This system is designed to be user-friendly, requiring no in-depth knowledge of company or local leave policies.

The primary goal is to shift responsibility to individual employees, enabling them to take control of this aspect of their employment in a clear, efficient, and self-service manner.

## 🧠 Domain (Problem Definition)

The objective of the system is to optimize internal business workflows by automating the approval process for time-off requests.

Previously, the process was manual and time-consuming. The new system will reduce administrative costs and delays by automating routine tasks while preserving control and oversight—especially for HR operations.

## 🔧 Functional Requirements

- **Flexible rules-based leave validation** – Validates leave requests using configurable rules.
- **Manager approval functionality** – Enables (optional) approval by managers.
- **Leave request date range support** – Supports leave from the previous year to 1.5 years in the future.
- **Email notifications** – Sends notifications for approvals and status updates.
- **Activity logging** – Logs all user transactions.
- **Override functionality** – HR/Admins can override rule-based actions (with logging).

## 📈 Non-Functional Requirements

- **Single sign-on authentication** – Uses intranet portal’s SSO.
- **Auditability** – Logs all actions, including overrides.
- **System extension** – Integrates as a part of the existing intranet portal.

---

## ⚠️ Constraints

- **Use of existing hardware/middleware** – Must run on current infrastructure.
- **Portal-based implementation** – Must be part of the intranet portal.
- **Single sign-on only** – No other authentication methods allowed.
