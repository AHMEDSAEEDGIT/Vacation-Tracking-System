# Vacation Tracking System (VTS) - ERD Version 

## Problem in V1
We can't track when status changes occurred or who made them, which is crucial for reporting and compliance.

&nbsp; 

### üîë Solution 
Create a new `RequestStatusHistory` table with these fields:
- `Id` (PK)
- `RequestId` (FK to Request)
- `Status` (enum: Pending/Approved/Rejected)
- `ChangedById` (FK to Employee - manager made the change)
- `ChangedAt` (timestamp)
- `Comment` (optional justification)

&nbsp;

### üõ† Changes to Existing Structure:
1. Keep the `Status` field in `Request` table for current state for simplicty
2. Remove any approval-related fields from `Request` table

## üí° Implementation Logic:
1. When status changes:
  - Insert new record in RequestStatusHistory
  - Update Status in Request table
2. To get full history:
   ```sql 
   SELECT * FROM RequestStatusHistory 
   WHERE RequestId = :requestId
   ORDER BY MangedAt DESC
   ```
3. ‚úí Add Approval Comments

> [!NOTE]
> Problem in `V1`:
> No way to capture why a request was approved/rejected.

> üîë Solution:
> Use the Comment field in RequestStatusHistory table added above.

--- 

## ‚úÖ New Approval Flow:
1. Employee submits request ‚Üí Creates first history record (Pending)
2. Manager approves/rejects ‚Üí Creates second history record
3. System can now:
  - Show full audit trail
  - Calculate approval times
  - Track multiple status changes

&nbsp;

### Get request with full history
```sql
SELECT r.*, h.Status, h.ManagedAt, e.Name AS e.Name ManagerName
FROM Request r
JOIN RequestStatusHistory h ON r.Id = h.RequestId
JOIN Employee e ON h.ManagedBy = e.Id
WHERE r.Id = :requestId
ORDER BY h.ManagedAt DESC
```
&nbsp; 

### üìù Calculate time in pending state:

```sql
SELECT TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR, MIN(ManagedAt), MAX(ManagedAt))
FROM RequestStatusHistory
WHERE RequestId = :requestId AND Status = 'Pending'
```

## üìà Version Comparison: V1 vs V2

| Feature/Capability       | V1                          | V2                          |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Implementation**       | Simpler to implement        | More complex due to history |
| **Database Structure**   | Fewer tables                | Additional history table    |
| **Query Performance**    | Faster for basic queries    | Slightly slower for history |
| **Audit Trail**          | ‚ùå No history tracking      | ‚úÖ Full audit trail         |
| **Response Metrics**     | ‚ùå No timing data           | ‚úÖ Response time metrics   |
| **Status Flexibility**   | ‚ùå Single status            | ‚úÖ Multiple status changes  |
| **Comments**            | ‚ùå No justification system  | ‚úÖ Comment field available  |
| **Compliance**          | ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic tracking only     | ‚úÖ Better compliance        |
| **Approval Workflow**   | ‚ùå Single-step              | ‚ö†Ô∏è Still single-approver   |
| **Delegation**          | ‚ùå No support               | ‚ùå Still no support        |

**Key Improvements in V2:**
- Added comprehensive audit logging
- Enabled status change tracking
- Introduced comment/justification system
- Gained ability to measure response times

**Remaining Limitations (for V3):**
- Still single-approver workflow
- No delegation capabilities
- No SLA/timeout handling
